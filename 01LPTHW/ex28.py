# True and True --> True
# False and False --> False
# 1 == 1 and 2 == 1 --> False


# solve the Boolean logic statements, you can solve them easily
# by this simple process:
# 1. Find an equality test (== or !=) and replace it with its truth.
# 2. Find each and/or inside parentheses and solve those first.
# 3. Find each not and invert it.
# 4. Find any remaining and/or and solve it.
# 5. When you are done you should have True or False.
